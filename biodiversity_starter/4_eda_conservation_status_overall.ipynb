    "# Describing Conservation Status Across Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis describes the **distribution of conservation status classifications** across all recorded observations in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to establish a clear **baseline understanding** of how conservation status categories are represented overall, prior to examining differences by park or other subgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context and Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a prior **methodological validation step**, which established that observation structure is consistent across parks at the chosen level of aggregation. Building on that foundation, the present analysis focuses on **descriptive characterization**, not comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis therefore examines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overall frequency and proportion of conservation status categories\n",
    "* Dataset-level representation, aggregated across all parks and taxa\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytical Question\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is the overall distribution of conservation status classifications in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Aggregate observations by conservation status\n",
    "2. Compute total counts and relative proportions\n",
    "3. Visualize the distribution using simple summary plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Counts and proportions are presented together to provide both scale and relative context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretive Boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "* Conservation status labels reflect **classification frequency**, not species abundance or population size\n",
    "* Observation counts are influenced by reporting effort and data collection practices\n",
    "* This analysis does not assess ecological risk or conservation outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Results here serve as **descriptive context** for subsequent comparative analyses rather than standalone inference.\n"
